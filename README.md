### Info
Multi Currency is a plugin which can be used in Bukkit, Spigot or Paper server. I don't know if
it works in "optimized paper-forks" so use at your own discretion. It is recommended to use Paper server as it
features Tuinity and its optimizations.

**Note : The plugin is being developed so there might be mistakes in codes**

### Installation
Well it's easy installing it to your server. Just drag and drop it into your plugins folder. Be sure to install its required
dependencies.
